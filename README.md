🧠 Principal Component Analysis (PCA) — Unsupervised Learning Presentation
-
🎯 Overview
-
This repository contains a PowerPoint presentation explaining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) — a fundamental technique in unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction in Data Science.

The slides are designed for both beginners and intermediate learners who want to understand how PCA works, why it’s used, and how to visualize it effectively.

📘 Presentation Outline
1️⃣ Introduction to PCA
-
What is PCA and why it is important

Real-world motivation for dimensionality reduction

2️⃣ Intuition Behind PCA
-
Geometric and statistical understanding

Variance maximization and orthogonal components

3️⃣ PCA in the ML Pipeline
-
Where PCA fits in the data preprocessing stage

Connection to clustering and visualization

4️⃣ Mathematics of PCA
-
Covariance matrix

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

Projection of data onto principal components

5️⃣ Choosing Number of Components
-
Explained variance and cumulative variance curve

Scree plot visualization (90–95% variance threshold)

6️⃣ Visualization Examples
-
3D → 2D data projection

Before & After PCA clustering visualization

Cumulative explained variance curve

PCA word cloud summary

Key Takeaways
-
PCA simplifies high-dimensional data

Enhances interpretability without major information loss

Commonly used before clustering, visualization, and model training
